This is a lost and found web application I built for students at my university to make it easier to keep track of misplaced items on campus. Users can post items they’ve found, search for what they’ve lost, and claim things directly through the app. I created the full system myself using Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and React, focusing on clean design, fast search, and a simple workflow so students can actually use it day-to-day. It’s been used by more than 20 students so far, and I’m continuing to add new features as I improve the project.
